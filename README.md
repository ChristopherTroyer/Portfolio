## RISC-V RV32I simulator:
  ### Responsibilities: Solo project.
  #### Language: C++
  
  Implementation of a RV32I RISC-V CPU following a provided specifications manual, loads and runs binaries from a terminal.

  Has input files and expected output files in their own directories.

## E-commerse web store:
  ### Responsibilities: HTML for pages, majority of CSS styling and formatting. SQL debugging.
  #### Languages: PHP, CSS, SQL
  
  Simulation of an E-commerse website.
  
  Database designed using a Entity-Relationship model.
  
  Manages orders, user accounts, 'shopping carts', and tracks the store's inventory.

## SARS-Cov-2 Genome Analysis:
  ### Responsibilities: Primary Developer in an interdisiplinary group.
  #### Language: Python
  
  In a group led by a PHD candidate in biology, I was tasked with generating data for a presentation on the relation between SARS-Cov-2 and other SARS-related coronavirus.
  
  For the final project I wrote a Python script that takes in '.maf' (Multiple Alignment Format) files and generates phylogenetic trees based on a choice of three aglorithms. 

  I also took the lead on our final presentation on our findings. 

## Quote System:
  ### Responsibilities: Database planning. Use case planning, wrote most of the use/actor table and related Diagrams.
  #### Languages: PHP, CSS, SQL
  Using an Agile methodology we constructed a website that would generate price quotes for a fictional buisness.
    
  This site was required to be compatable with a locked down legacy database, and send orders via POST requests to a RESTful processing system.
  
  The site had to implement it's own associate and quotes managment (update, view, search, delete) including user accounts for different levels of access to the database.
  
  I also took on setting up and running a LAMP stack on a rented server. I also wrote a setup guide for my group members so they could run a server of their own.
