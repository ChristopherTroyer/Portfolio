## SARS-Cov-2 Genome Analysis:
  ### Responsibilities: Primary Developer in an interdisiplinary group.
  #### Language: Python
  
  In a group led by a PHD candidate in biology, I was tasked with generating data for a presentation on the relation between SARS-Cov-2 and other SARS-related coronavirus.
  
  For the final project I wrote a Python script that takes in '.maf' (Multiple Alignment Format) files and generates phylogenetic trees based on a choice of three aglorithms. 

  I also took the lead on our final presentation on our findings.
